**R Markdown Syntax**

**1 : Show an example where the chunk option cache = T leads to a misleading answer. This example must be different from the one presented in the textbook.**

``{r computeA, cache=TRUE}
a = 20


{r, cache=TRUE}
(m = a/2)``


**2 : Simulate 100 random samples from a Uniform(0,1) distribution using the function runif(). Store these 100 values in a vector called x. Then, compute the empirical mean, median and variance of x. Are these results different from 1/2, 1/2 and 1/12 (their respective theoretical values)? Is this result surprising? Justify your answer**
  
``set.seed(100)
samples<-runif(n=100, min=0, max=1)
print(samples)``

**3 : Include a graph showing the histogram of x (make sure to include a caption to this figure), this can be done in R using the function hist().**
